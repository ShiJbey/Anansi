## [0.3.0] - 2024-06-08

This update focused on making the story controller more general purpose for projects that want to take advantage of the storylet system for dialogue, but who don't need all the additional infrastructure provided by the full framework.

### Added

- Added `Anansi.Story` class as `Ink.Runtime.Story` wrapper to enable people to use storylets without MonoBehaviour components.

- Combined various `Get__Input` external functions into a single function.
- Moved action location storylet management to the `GameManager`

### Removed
